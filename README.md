## Explanations about the language

- Takes a file with extension .Sanctum
- Has if, while,for,else,equal,define,notequal,isPrime
and also we use Printf function ...

-we are planing to make similar to C and Java.
-You can run our program using ./Sanctum< test.Sanctum
-After the run process if you see result 0 it means the number you send to method is not prime if you see 1 it means number is prime number.

Here you can see what we tested in our language.

By the way we only tested isPrime program but many arithmetic and simple math programs can be run with our language Sanctum.
